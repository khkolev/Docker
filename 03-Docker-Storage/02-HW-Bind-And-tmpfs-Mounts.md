# Homework Bind Mounts and tmpfs Mounts 
## Task 1: Working with Bind Mounts

Bind mounts allow you to map a host file or directory to a container. This task will help you understand how to use bind mounts for development purposes.

1. **Setup a Development Environment**: Create a simple HTML file on your host machine.
2. **Run a Container with a Bind Mount**: Use the `nginx` image to run a container that serves the HTML file using a bind mount.
3. **Modify the HTML File**: Change the HTML file on your host and observe how the changes are immediately reflected in the container.

## Task 2: Sharing Configuration Files

Use bind mounts to share configuration files between the host and containers.

1. **Create a Configuration File**: On your host, create a configuration file for an application (e.g., `myapp.config`).
2. **Run a Container with the Configuration**: Start a container that uses this configuration file through a bind mount.
3. **Update and Reload Configuration**: Modify the configuration file on the host and demonstrate how the container can use the updated configuration without restarting.

## Task 3: Persistent Logging with Bind Mounts

Implement persistent logging for a container using bind mounts.

1. **Setup Logging Directory**: On your host, create a directory for log files.
2. **Run a Container with Log Directory Mounted**: Start a container that writes its logs to this directory.
3. **Analyze Logs**: Access and analyze the log files from the host machine.

## Task 4: Exploring tmpfs Mounts

tmpfs mounts allow you to store data in the host system's memory, which is useful for sensitive information or for improving performance.

1. **Run a Container with tmpfs**: Start a container with a tmpfs mount for storing temporary data.
2. **Test Data Volatility**: Write data to the tmpfs mount and restart the container to verify that the data does not persist.

## Task 5: Combining Bind Mounts and tmpfs Mounts

In this task, you will use both bind mounts and tmpfs mounts within the same container to achieve specific data management objectives.

1. **Design a Scenario**: Think of a scenario where both persistent data (using bind mounts) and volatile data (using tmpfs mounts) are needed. For example, a web application that logs access logs persistently but stores session data in volatile storage.
2. **Implement the Scenario**: Run a container implementing this scenario, mapping the appropriate directories to bind mounts and tmpfs mounts accordingly.
3. **Evaluate the Setup**: Discuss the benefits and limitations of your setup, focusing on data management, performance, and security.
