# Docker Image Homework Tasks

### Task 1: Create a Dockerfile for a Simple Web Server
Create a `Dockerfile` for a simple web server using the `nginx` image. Customize the default `nginx` page by adding a custom `index.html` file. Build the image and run a container from it to verify that your custom page is served.

### Task 2: Build a Docker Image for a Node.js Application
Write a `Dockerfile` for a Node.js application. Your Dockerfile should copy the application files into the image, install dependencies, and start the application. Test the image by running a container and accessing the Node.js application endpoint.

### Task 3: Optimize Dockerfile with Multi-Stage Builds
Modify the Dockerfile from Task 2 to use multi-stage builds. The first stage should install dependencies and build the application if necessary. The second stage should copy the built application from the first stage and prepare the runtime environment. This approach minimizes the size of the final image.

### Task 4: Tag and Push an Image to Docker Hub
Tag the Docker image you created in Task 2 with your Docker Hub username and push it to Docker Hub. Ensure you log in to Docker Hub from the CLI before pushing the image. Verify that the image is available in your Docker Hub repository.

### Task 5: Create a Dockerfile that Uses Environment Variables
Create a `Dockerfile` for an application that uses environment variables to configure settings. Use the `ENV` instruction to set default values for the variables. Demonstrate how to override these values by passing environment variables when running a container from the image.
